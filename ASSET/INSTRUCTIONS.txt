1. Go to this link:
https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/installation

2.Execute this command in the "cmd":
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel blog "6.*"

3.Then go to:
https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/frontend

4.And select Frontend Scaffolding.

5.Execute this command in the "cmd":
composer require laravel/ui:^1.0 --dev

6.As we will use React for this project we need to Execute the given Command:
this will prepare the scaffold:
php artisan ui react

7.Then we have to run the command "npm install" to get all the needed npm component.

--------------------------------

8.After managing the react file structures at "resources" directory we must got to the "webpack.main.js" file
	
	there are some methods for webpack. As we have created the react file architecture manually we have to import 
	those through webpack. for those we can add some command in the webpack file.
	such ase:
	
	mix.copy(from,to); //for file
	mix.copyDirectory(from,to); //for folder

	After all these we have to run "npm run dev" in the "cmd" so that the webpack module bundle can start its work.

9. After a successful build we have to go to the "resources/view" directory and create a "index.bloade.php" file.
 	in the "index.bloade.php" file we have to make a plain <html> file which will contain <head> & <body> section
	for making connections with css/script files & other CDN services.

10.Than we have to visit to the "routes/web.php" file and routhe that "index.blade.php" file.



11. now install React Bootstrap, React Font Awesome ,
	REACT ROUTER , REACT ROUTER DoM 
 	[AXIOS is installed as default during Scaffolding]

12.********************************************************
"npm run watch" is to see the frequent update of the development
*************************************************************

13.Laravel+React bundle can not support ARROW Functions and some other ES6 features.

14. After Routing all the pages add this portion of code in the "routes/web.php" file:
	Route::get('{AnyRoute}', function () {
    	return view('index');
	})->where('AnyRoute','.*');
    So that it can find all the react pages through "index"

15. Now we have to make Model & Controller.

Controller Command: php artisan make:Controller NAME

16. Page Rount can be maintained from "resources/route/AppRoute.js"
	but for CRUD operation "web.php" route will be used for finding the controller.

17.To keep the user loged in we are using sesson. so we need a middleware to verify user login status
	during users every operation.The command is given below:
	php artisan make:Middleware "name"
